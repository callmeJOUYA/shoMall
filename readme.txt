Dear reviewer,

Welcome to my project repository. This repository showcases a simple e-commerce template that I have designed to demonstrate my proficiency in HTML and CSS. The primary objective of this project is solely to showcase my skills in these two areas and does not have any other specific goals.

Within this project, I have designed a homepage and a user login page. However, the responsive design for these two pages is still a work in progress. Please note that this project serves as a sample and its main focus is on HTML and CSS.

I am committed to continuously improving my web development skills and aim to enhance this project. Through this repository, I aim to demonstrate my ability to design and develop robust and professional user interfaces.

I look forward to receiving your feedback and comments on this project. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out. Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
mohmmad ahmadi.
